# Pizza Bot

**Not finish yet!**. In fact, its just starting.

A bot for ordering pizza without closing the terminal.

## Currently supported shops:

### Official Method

Currently all the shops are scraped so...
If in future, a shop is introduced using an oficial API, it will appear here.

### With unofficial methods

We are actively developing 2 shops while we wait to be hungrier.

## You are a business owner and want your shop to be supported too?

Oh, thats great. Easy steps to achieve that.

## Im in love with this idea! How can I contribute?

### Boosting our development

Well, we need to buy pizza in diferent places in order to "reverse engineer" how the diferent web platforms works. So... donating to the cause will let us buy pizza and coffe to continue developing.

### Developing new modules

You can develop new modules for new Pizza shops.

Feel free to bring pizza to your local developers.

### Developing addons for text editors

It will be great if people could order pizza without closing their IDE.

### Test modules made by other people by eating pizza!

We will need pizza volunteers to order pizzas using pizzaBot in locations were we cant.

### Stay healthy

We want our contibutors to continue contributing so please, make sport, eat pinneapple and don't die.
